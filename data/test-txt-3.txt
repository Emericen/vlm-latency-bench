Judy Garland (born Frances Ethel Gumm; June 10, 1922–June 22, 1969) was an American actress and singer. Possessing a strong contralto voice, she was celebrated for her emotional depth and versatility across film, stage, and concert performance. Garland achieved international recognition for her portrayal of Dorothy Gale in The Wizard of Oz (1939). Her rendition of "Over the Rainbow" won the Academy Award for Best Original Song, and became Garland's signature song.

Garland began her career at the age of two: performing with her two older sisters as a vaudeville act called The Gumm Sisters. In 1935, aged 13, she signed a contract with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) and was initially cast in supporting roles in ensemble musicals such as Broadway Melody of 1938 (1937) and Thoroughbreds Don't Cry (1937). The success of The Wizard of Oz propelled her into leading roles in MGM musicals, including Meet Me in St. Louis (1944), Easter Parade (1948), and Summer Stock (1950). In the 1950s and early 1960s, she expanded her range with dramatic performances in A Star Is Born (1954) and Judgment at Nuremberg (1961), both of which earned Academy Award nominations and demonstrated her capacity to convey vulnerability and resilience on screen.

Beyond her film work, Garland had a distinguished singing career in recordings and live performance. Between 1939 and 1962, she recorded 11 studio albums. Several of her recordings were later inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame. Her 1961 live album Judy at Carnegie Hall won the Grammy Award for Album of the Year. In the same year she became the first woman to receive the Cecil B. DeMille Award for lifetime achievement in motion pictures (aged 39 at the time, she remains the youngest recipient of that award). Her honors also include a Golden Globe Award, an Academy Juvenile Award for her early contributions, and a Special Tony Award for her role in reviving vaudeville. In 1997 she was posthumously awarded a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award, and in 1999 the American Film Institute ranked her eighth among the greatest female screen legends of classic Hollywood cinema.

Garland's personal life was marked by both public fascination and private struggle. She married five times and had three children, including actresses and singers Liza Minnelli and Lorna Luft. From her teenage years onward, she faced health challenges exacerbated by studio pressures on her appearance and performance. She developed dependencies on prescription medications that affected her physical and mental well-being. Financial difficulties, including substantial tax debts, added to her burdens. She died from an accidental barbiturate overdose at age 47 in 1969.

Garland's resilience, artistic range and enduring recordings have ensured her lasting impact on popular culture and her reputation as a cultural icon.

Early life
Garland was born Frances Ethel Gumm on June 10, 1922, in Grand Rapids, Minnesota.[2][3] She was the youngest child of vaudevillians Ethel Marion Milne and Francis Avent Gumm.[4] She was named after both of her parents and baptized at a local Episcopal church.[5] Her parents had met and married in Wisconsin, and then settled in Grand Rapids, where they operated a movie theater showcasing vaudeville acts. She was of Irish, English, Scottish,[6][7] and Huguenot[8][9] ancestry.

"Baby" (as she was called by her parents and sisters)[10] shared her family's flair for song and dance. Her first appearance came at the age of two, when she joined her elder sisters Mary Jane "Suzy/Suzanne" Gumm and Dorothy Virginia "Jimmie" Gumm on the stage of her father's movie theater during a Christmas show to sing a chorus of "Jingle Bells."[11] The Gumm Sisters performed there for the next few years, accompanied by their mother on piano.[10]


Garland's birthplace in Grand Rapids, Minnesota, is now a museum dedicated to her life and career.
The family relocated to Lancaster, California, in June 1926, following rumors that her father had homosexual inclinations.[12] Frank bought and operated another theater in Lancaster,[13] and Ethel began managing her daughters and working to get them into motion pictures.[citation needed]

Career
1928–1935: The Gumm/Garland Sisters
In 1928, the Gumm Sisters enrolled in a dance school run by Ethel Meglin, proprietor of the Meglin Kiddies dance troupe, and appeared with the troupe at its annual Christmas show.[14] Through the Meglin Kiddies, the sisters made their film debut in a short subject called The Big Revue (1929), where they performed a song-and-dance number called "That's the Good Old Sunny South." This was followed by appearances in two Vitaphone shorts the following year: A Holiday in Storyland, featuring Garland's first on-screen solo, and The Wedding of Jack and Jill. They next appeared together in Bubbles (1930). Their final on-screen appearance was in an MGM Technicolor short entitled La Fiesta de Santa Barbara (1935).[15]

The trio had toured the vaudeville circuit as "The Gumm Sisters" for many years by the time they performed in Chicago at the Oriental Theater with George Jessel in 1934. He encouraged the group to choose a more appealing name after "Gumm" was met with laughter from the audience. According to theater legend, their act was once erroneously billed at a Chicago theater as "The Glum Sisters."[16]
